# Projects Overview
This course explored concepts in automata theory through in class instruction and hands-on projects during the Spring 2024 semester. The projects were all done using Java and its various libraries.

- **[Deterministic Finite Automata](./p1/)** - A program modeling DFAs, implementing states, state transitions and string acceptance checks.
- **[Nondeterministic Finite Automata](./p2/)** - A program modeling NFAs, supporting multiple transitions on the same symbol, epsilon transitions, and string acceptance. Contains a check for determinism.
- **[Turing Machine](./p3/)** - A program simulating a Turing Machine, processing file inputs to determine the number of states and number of inputs. It will output the final tape, containing its length and the sum of symbols.

Each project directory contains its own README with specific implementation details and requirements.
